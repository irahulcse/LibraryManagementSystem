# LibraryManagementSystem
A Library management system, purely developed in C++. It facilitates user to perform all the operation basis on the user choices, numerically. 

# What it does !!
It is a simple C++ project which demonstrates end to end library management system. It is basically demonstrating usages of OOPs concept, where no external database used. All the input and output is through binary text files. 
Usages of binary files makes it more efficient and no licenses etc used.

# Prerequisites
System Requirement: Windows 95 or above.
# Installation
Its executable file (.EXE), which do not require any specially installation. It's fully portable and no hardware dependency.



# Development
This a small project developed as a part of my first B Tech program. It usages Turbo C++/Dev++ as IDE.
Most code is self explanatory. Three primary languages - C++. 
The flow of the system is :
1.	It can be run in Windows/DOS, since it is .EXE file.
2.	Master and transaction files are created automatically in the environment in which it is developed.
3.	Native host Turbo C++/Dev++.
4.	Project starts with user authentication, i.e. User Id & Password.
5.	Default userid and password to run this project is Rahul.
6.	It allows user to Manage Library Member and Books i.e. Addition, Modification & Deletion of existing records through binary files.
7.	Book  is issued to only registered member and that too - One book at a time.
8.	While returning book similar checks are performed.
9.	Project interface is smooth and portable across menus.


# Suggested Work
This is yet not the full fledge project for the Library management  System, but I will try to make it better with the passage of time.
1.	Username  and Password System: In this project u should manually change the username and password  in the void checkpass() function. By default the username and password is Rahul.
2.	The quantity of the book remains unchanged after issuing the book. So there is the need of the new function integration with trans class through which we can the number of the items in the code.
3.	The issue data and return date does not generate on its own for the everyday u should change it manually.
